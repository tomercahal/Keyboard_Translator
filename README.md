Have you ever typed something before and then realized it's in the wrong language so you have to rewrite it? Say hello to keyboard Translator.\
I wanted to learn electron and node.js for a bigger project I am planning and I had this cool Idea to create a The Ketboard Translator. \ A windows application that you can enter the language you want to translate from and to, enter your jibrish text (because your keyboard was in the wrong language) and you will get what you actually meant to write.

**Goals for the future of this project:**

         1. Integrate the prompt of choosing the language and giving the jibrish into the html code, for better UX.
         2. As of right now, it looks kinda ugly, so learn CSS and add it to make the application look better.
         3. Add support for more languages:exclamation::exclamation:
         
## To Run: ##
I used electron and node.js. Click [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/installation) to install electron, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install node.js.\
I recommend using Visual Studio code, which you can get in [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Once you have downloaded all of the files that are in this repository, run `npm install` this will install all of the Node Packages that are used in this project.

I hope you enjoy this project, and if you have and suggestions please let me know!
